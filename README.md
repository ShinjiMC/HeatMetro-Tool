# HeatMetro: A 3D Code Visualization for Test Debt Analysis in Evolving Systems

**HeatMetro** is a tool based on the Code City metaphor designed to visualize Test Debt in Java and Go projects. It operationalizes the **Context-Aware Code Coverage** criteria to highlight critical components where high complexity and churn intersect with low test reliability.

This repository contains the replication package and instructions to execute the **Builder** (analysis engine) and generate the visualization.
